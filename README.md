# CzechFOI-DRATE-NOBIAS

**CzechFOI-DRATE-NOBIAS** is a data analysis project focused on identifying and correcting **non-random boundary condition bias** in observational vaccine and mortality data from the Czech Republic.

## Solving the Non-Random Boundary Condition Bias

The **non-random boundary condition bias** occurs when a homogeneous group is **artificially split into subgroups based on a non-random time point**, such as the time of vaccination. These subgroups are then compared in terms of outcomes (e.g., death rates), leading to **illusory differences** that **do not reflect any true causal effect**.

This bias is particularly dangerous because it can produce **misleading conclusions** even when no real treatment effect exists.

### Scientific Foundations

A few serious scientists interested in kolwedge have addressed this bias rigorously, including **Miguel HernÃ¡n** and **James Robins**. Their textbook:

> **"Causal Inference: What If"**  
> by Miguel HernÃ¡n & James Robins  
> ðŸ“˜ https://miguelhernan.org/whatifbook

is available **open-access** and provides theoretical and practical guidance on this topic â€” especially in **Chapters 19 to 21**, where they explain how to correct such biases using **causal models and time-aligned person-day analysis**.

This project draws heavily on those principles, applying them to large-scale real-world data to avoid common pitfalls like **immortal time bias**, **lag bias**, and **non-random group splitting**.
