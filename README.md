# CzechFOI-DRATE-NOBIAS

**CzechFOI-DRATE-NOBIAS** is a data analysis project focused on identifying and correcting **non-random boundary condition bias** in observational vaccine and mortality data from the Czech Republic.

## Solving the Non-Random Boundary Condition Bias

The **non-random boundary condition bias** occurs when a homogeneous group is **artificially split into subgroups based on a non-random time point**, such as the time of vaccination with the **constraint death day > last dose day**. These subgroups are then compared in terms of outcomes (e.g., death rates), leading to **illusory differences** that **do not reflect any true causal effect**.

This bias is particularly dangerous because it can produce **misleading conclusions** even when no real treatment effect exists.

### Methode
A population with a 
constant mortality rate is simulated, and real vaccine doses 1–7 are randomly assigned to individuals, repeating the process until the individual’s death day occurs after their last vaccination. 
This creates a dataset with a constant homogeneous mortality rate and a realistic vaccination schedule.
<br><br>The simulated and real datasets are then tested using scientific methods such as the time-varying Cox model to prove whether the methode eliminate this bias in the data, or produce distorted results.

### Scientific Foundations

A few serious scientists, genuinely interested in knowledge, have addressed this bias rigorously, including **Miguel Hernán** and **James Robins**. 
<br>Their textbook:

> **"Causal Inference: What If"**  
> by Miguel Hernán & James Robins  
> 📘 https://miguelhernan.org/whatifbook

thankfully is available **open-access** and provides theoretical and practical guidance on this topic — especially in **Chapters 19 to 21**, where they explain how to correct such biases using **causal models and time-aligned person-day analysis**.

This project draws heavily on those principles, applying them to large-scale real-world data to avoid common pitfalls like **immortal time bias**, **lag bias**, and **non-random group splitting**.

## The Solution of Non-Random Boundary Condition Bias

This is what **Hernán & Robins** say:

> **“Don’t compare vaccinated people with unvaccinated people. Compare person-time under vaccination vs. person-time without vaccination.”**

---

### Why is this not a problem for comparison?

Because you no longer say:

> **“Group A (vx) vs. Group B (uvx)”**

But rather:

> **“What is the hazard rate during vaccinated periods compared to unvaccinated periods”**

This is **fair** because:

- All individuals contribute to the risk time of **both groups** (depending on their vaccination status over time).
- No one is excluded **"from the outset"** due to the timing of vaccination.

---

### The **wrong** model (which is often used):

You put all vaccinated people in one group and all unvaccinated people in another – and then compare the two groups.

But:

> ❌ **That’s unfair!**

Because:

- The **bias is already baked into the observational real-world data** due to non-random splitting into the two groups.

That means:

- It doesn’t help to randomly assign doses only to the vaccinated group, as the bias is already introduced by real world constraint death day > last dose day.
- If you randomly assigne the doses to the entire population, it would eliminate the bias — but this would destroy the real relation of vx/uvx grouping you actually want to compare.
- Therefore, you need to find another way to eliminate the bias from the raw data — and **Hernán & Robins** showed how to do this.

## Comparison vaccinated vs. unvaccinated with eliminated bias - using different Methodes  

**I have not yet found a scientific Cox/Poisson time-varying Methode that completely eliminates the bias caused by the restriction “date of death > date of last dose” in order to fairly compare vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals and calculate efficacy**

Since most scientists use R code, I will shortly be publishing the R code scripts.

## FZ) Poisson Regression

**Study Period sart date 2020-01-01 until END_MEASURE 1095 days**

**Notes**
- This model uses **person-day data**, expanding individual records by time.
- A **Poisson model with log link** is typically appropriate for **rare event count data** like deaths per day.
- The null result here may indicate **insufficient effect** in the simulated data (HR ~ 1), or structural bias due to **model or data design**.

### Simulated Deaths with random real dose schedule AG70 (expected HR~1 / no effect-placebo) Poisson Methode

**PerfectSeparationWarning**:  
  `Perfect separation or prediction detected, parameter may not be identified.`  
  This indicates that the model perfectly predicts the outcome for some observations — a sign of either overfitting or a non-informative predictor.

### Coefficients and IRRs

| Covariate   | Coef        | IRR (exp(coef)) | 95% CI        | p-value | Interpretation |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|---------------|---------|----------------|
| `const`     | ≈ 0         | **1.000**        | [1.000, 1.000]| 1.000   | No baseline death risk change |
| `vaccinated`| ≈ 0         | **1.000**        | [1.000, 1.000]| 1.000   | **No effect detected**        |
| `age_c`     | 0           | –                | [0, 0]        | NaN     | Possibly constant or missing  |

### Interpretation

- **No difference** in death incidence between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals was detected in this simulation.
- The coefficient for `vaccinated` is extremely close to zero, with an **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) of 1.000**, meaning **no relative change in death rate**.
- **Perfect separation** warning suggests either:
  - There is no variation in the outcome with respect to predictors.
  - The data or simulation design causes deterministic outcomes (e.g., deaths assigned in a fixed or rule-based way).
- `age_c` was dropped due to data only for AG70

### Coefficients and Incidence Rate Ratios (IRRs)

| Covariate     | Coef     | IRR (exp(coef)) | 95% CI IRR         | p-value | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------|------------------|---------------------|---------|----------------|
| `const`       | -0.0003  | ~1.000           | [0.999, 1.000]      | 0.009   | Slightly lower baseline risk |
| `vaccinated`  | -0.0013  | **0.999**        | [0.998, 0.999]      | <0.001  | **Statistically significant reduction** in death rate for vaccinated individuals |
| `age_c`       | 0        | –                | [0, 0]              | NaN     | Possibly dropped due to no variation or collinearity |


### Interpretation

- **Vaccinated individuals** show a **statistically significant** but **very small reduction** in daily death rates compared to unvaccinated.
  - **IRR = 0.999** → about **0.1% lower** death rate.
- The **pseudo R² is low (0.0335)**, indicating that vaccination explains only a small portion of the variability in death counts.
- The model converged after 5 iterations with valid diagnostics.

## Essentials to Eliminate the Bias

### Use person-time analysis instead of person-group comparison:
- Don’t divide individuals into **"vaccinated"** vs. **"unvaccinated"** groups.
- Instead, **split each individual's time** into **vaccinated** and **unvaccinated periods**.

### Ensure that follow-up time is correctly aligned:
- The **start of follow-up** must be defined equally for all individuals (e.g., a shared baseline date or event).
- Avoid **immortal time bias** — no one should be counted as "at risk" before they are actually at risk.
- For example use **Target Trial Emulation (TTE)** veryone in the emulated trial starts at the same time — e.g., the date when all were eligible for vaccination. This eliminates biases caused by unequal follow-up periods or survival prerequisites.

### Allow individuals to contribute to both exposure states:
- A person can contribute **unvaccinated person-time** before receiving a dose and **vaccinated person-time** afterward.
- This ensures comparisons are **within the same population**, not between fundamentally different groups.

### Don’t condition on future information:
- You must **not use future events** (e.g., dose received later) to define exposure status at earlier times.
